# Bandwidth Management System

A Java-based simulation project that demonstrates how network bandwidth
can be allocated and managed using priority-based scheduling.

This project simulates the behavior of a network router that handles
multiple users requesting bandwidth under limited capacity.

## Key Features
- Simulates multiple users requesting bandwidth
- Priority-based traffic scheduling using Priority Queue
- Handles bandwidth congestion and packet dropping
- Demonstrates basic Quality of Service (QoS) concepts

## Data Structures Used
- Priority Queue
- Queue
- Sorting

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## Project Structure
- Main.java – Entry point of the application
- User.java – Represents a network user
- TrafficPacket.java – Represents traffic packets with priority
- BandwidthManager.java – Handles bandwidth allocation logic

## How to Run
1. Compile all Java files:
   javac *.java
2. Run the program:
   java Main
